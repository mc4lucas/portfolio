                Two important stats in baseball are the team batting average and the team slugging average.
                Batting average is defined as the total number of hits (this includes 1 base hits, 2 base hits, 3
                base hits and home runs combined) divided by the total number of times at bat (“at bats”) for
                all players on the team. The team slugging average is defined using the following equation:
            </p>

        </div>

            <p class="list">
                Where A is the number of 1 base hits, B is 2 base hits, C is 3 base hits, D is home runs, and E is
                the number of at bats for all players on the team. Both slugging and batting averages are
                always presented as decimals rounded to 3 places, leaving off the leading 0 (in theory batting
                averages can be as high as 1.000, and slugging averages as high as 4.000 but in practice they
                are both usually well below 1).
                DATA11.txt (DATA12.txt for the second try) contains the raw data on the top 10 teams during
                a regular season of Major League Baseball. The first line is the season name, followed by 10
                lines for each of the top 10 teams. Each of these lines starts with a team name (single word)
                followed by 7 integers: Games Played, At Bats, Runs, Hits (total), two-base hits, three-base
                hits, and home runs. One space character separates each item on each line.
                Write a program to produce a report showing the batting and slugging averages for each team
                in the order they appeared in the input file, and formatted EXACTLY as shown below,
                including all punctuation and matching upper and lower case exactly. All spacing is done with
                a single space character. All batting and slugging averages will be less than 1. The final line
                shows the same averages for all 10 teams combined (computed from the sum of all at bats,
                hits, etc. for all 10 teams). Note that the two lines of “=” characters each contain 20 characters.
